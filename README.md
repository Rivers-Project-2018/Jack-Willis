###Rating Curve for the River Aire


When planning flood mitigation, it is important to estimate the volume of water that the river will flood by, in order to see which flood alleviation schemes are most appropriate. We call this the flood excess volume (FEV). To calculate the FEV of a flood, first data must be collected and analyzed from the Environmental Agency. They analyze the river level (height) against a timestamp usually at 15 minute intervals across hundreds of gauge stations over the country. For each individual gauge station, it is possible to estimate the threshold level of the river *h<sub>T</sub>*, measured in m. This value can be estimated many different ways, from social media time stamped photos to online live resources such as (www.gaugemap.com). To analyze this data, a rating curve is created by the Environmental Agency to estimate the flow of water (m^3/s) m<sup>3</sup>/s at the riverâ€™s given level and time.
